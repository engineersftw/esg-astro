## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
├── public/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── content/
│   ├── layouts/
│   └── pages/
├── astro.config.mjs
├── README.md
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See [Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
| `npm run db:start`        | Start the Supabase Local Dev                     |
| `npm run db:stop`         | Stops the Supabase Local Dev                     |

## Preparing the Dev Database

1. Start Supabase local

    ```bash
    npm run db:start
    ```

    > Note the Secret key

2. Import the backup file:

    ```
    psql -d postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres -f ./db_cluster-06-06-2025.backup
    ```

    > **Note:** You may need to install Postgres to get the `psql` CLI.

3. Update `.env` with the Secret Key. (If `.env` is not available, copy `env.example` to `.env` and update the contents).

4. To stop the Supabase local

    ```bash
    npm run db:stop
    ```
